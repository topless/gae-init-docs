The easiest way to add a frontend library is:

1. Add it as a dependecy in the
   [`bower.json`](https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init/blob/master/bower.json), or try from console `bower install --save dependency-name`
2. Update some possible overrides
3. Execute the `gulp` command if it's
   not already running.
4. Include the the styles in the
   [`styles.less`](https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init/blob/master/main/static/src/style/style.less).
5. Include the scripts by updating the `ext` section in
   [`config.coffee`](https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init/blob/master/gulp/config.coffee).

By following these steps you will not need to add the third party libraries
into your repository and everything will be minified before deployment.

If you are not able to include it as a bower dependency, simply create a new
folder under the
[`main/static/`](https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init/tree/master/main/static)
directory and include them as descibed in the steps 3â€”5 above.
